<h6>About me</h6>

My first interaction with programming was at university, where I learned c++. Fast forward to the current
time and now I am a frontend web developer with almost 2 years of working experience. I am capable of creating pixel perfect, mobile
first - fully responsive websites, with SEO optimization and accessibility in mind. I specialize in the javascript ecosystem and have
experience with working almost all the major js frameworks such as React, Angular, Vue and Svelte. I help companies to create fully
featured, interactive web applications.
